## Sprint 1 â€“ MVP Development
Sprint Goal: Build the foundational structure and critical backend components for managing vehicle loaning, tracking, and servicing using ServiceNowâ€™s Scoped Application framework.

**Overview:**
The primary objective of Sprint 1 was to set up the Loaner Vehicle Request and Inventory application as a standalone scoped app in ServiceNow. This included defining tables, forms, user roles, navigation modules, importing data, and configuring necessary form behaviors to ensure the system supports the basic vehicle lending process.

**Completed User Stories & Features:**
1. Scoped Application Setup
Created a new scoped application titled Loaner Vehicle Request and Inventory to isolate the logic and data structures from other ServiceNow modules.
Set application prefix, advanced settings, and created a custom role lva_user for table access management.
