## Sprint 1 â€“ MVP Development
Sprint Goal: Build the foundational structure and critical backend components for managing vehicle loaning, tracking, and servicing using ServiceNowâ€™s Scoped Application framework.

**Overview:**
The primary objective of Sprint 1 was to set up the Loaner Vehicle Request and Inventory application as a standalone scoped app in ServiceNow. This included defining tables, forms, user roles, navigation modules, importing data, and configuring necessary form behaviors to ensure the system supports the basic vehicle lending process.

**Completed User Stories & Features:**
1. Scoped Application Setup
   
Created a new scoped application titled Loaner Vehicle Request and Inventory to isolate the logic and data structures from other ServiceNow modules.
Set application prefix, advanced settings, and created a custom role lva_user for table access management.

2. Update Set Configuration
   
Established a dedicated Update Set to track all configuration changes made within this application scope, enabling version control and deployment portability.

8. Vehicle Servicing Table and Form
   
Created a Vehicle Servicing table to track maintenance and repairs.
Added Key fields and organized fields into Forms and assigned a separate role for access management.

10. Related Lists Configuration
    
Established related list relationships between:
Loaner Vehicle Catalog â†” Vehicle Tracker
Loaner Vehicle Catalog â†” Vehicle Servicing
Vehicle Tracker â†” Vehicle Servicing

11. Form UI Policies
    
Added dynamic UI policies on the Vehicle Tracker form
Fields such as Assigned to, Location, and Expected Return Date are mandatory if Vehicle Status = Pending Release or Out on Field
Return Date, Return Status, and Return Notes become editable and mandatory when Vehicle Status = Returned for Inspection

13. UI Actions (Custom Buttons)
    
Implemented two custom buttons on the Vehicle Tracker form:
Return to Warehouse â€“ Updates status if vehicle is returned in good condition.
Send to Repair â€“ Triggers servicing workflow if vehicle needs repairs.
Buttons are conditionally visible based on form values

**Sprint Outcome:**
By the end of Sprint 1, we had a fully functioning MVP that:

-Captures and stores vehicles available for request

-Tracks loan requests and vehicle statuses

-Monitors servicing activities

-Enables users to request vehicles via the Service Portal


## Sprint 2 â€“ Feature Enhancement 
Sprint Goal: Implement client-side validations, automate loaner vehicle request processing, and configure access controls and notifications for secure and seamless operation.

**Overview:**
The focus of Sprint 2 was to elevate the MVP by adding automation, validation, and security features. This sprint emphasized form behavior through client scripts, built a flow to manage loaner vehicle approvals and fulfillment, and introduced access control rules and notifications to support real-world operational use.

**Completed User Stories & Features:**
1. Client Scripts for Catalog Form
Implemented a client script to auto-fill the Office Location field based on the selected Requested For user.
Then Validation script to ensure the Return Date is not before the Date Needed. If the validation fails, the return date is cleared and an error message is shown.

3. Request Loaner Vehicle Flow
Flow Design: Built a ServiceNow Flow to trigger on submission of the catalog item "Request Loaner Vehicle."
Also created a Group Setup
THis was created to streamline task assignments, workflow routing, and role-based access. Two distinct groups were defined: **Loaner Vehicle Approvers (with the approver_user role)** to handle approval of vehicle requests, and **Loaner Vehicle Delivery (with the itil role)** to manage fulfillment tasks once approvals are granted. This setup ensures requests are reviewed and approved before being actioned.

To maintain clarity and prevent overlap, each user is assigned to only one group. This separation of duties supports a clean workflow process, simplifies permissions management, and ensures accountability across the approval and fulfillment stages.

3. Access Control Rules (ACLs) and Groups
ACLs were implemented to ensure proper data security and role-based access within the Loaner Vehicle application.
The **Loaner Vehicle Catalog and Vehicle Tracker tables** allow all users to read data, but only users with the **lva_user role** can create or edit records, while deletion is restricted to **admins.**
For the Vehicle Servicing table, only users in the **Maintenance Team role** can read, create, or update records, and again, only admins can delete.
This setup ensures users can interact with the system based on their responsibilities without compromising data integrity.

New Roles & Groups:
To support role-based workflows, two specialized user groups were created. 
**Loaner Vehicle Warehouse Managers** were given full access to all three core tablesâ€”Catalog, Tracker, and **Loaner Vehicle Servicing** allowing them to oversee the end-to-end vehicle management process. 
Meanwhile, the Loaner Vehicle Maintenance Team was restricted to the Vehicle Servicing table, aligning their access strictly with repair and maintenance tasks. 
This clear separation of duties enforces accountability and prevents unauthorized actions across the application.
